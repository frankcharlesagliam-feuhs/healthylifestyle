                <h1>Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
                <p>Talking about a healthy lifestyle simply means it will help you be happy and feel good with regards
                    to your diet. There are some benefits in maintaining or achieving a healthy lifestyle. One of those
                    are the following:</p>

                <hr>
                <h2>Prevent you from having diseases</h2>
                <p>Healthy habits can reduce the risk of a variety of illnesses, including those that can affect your
                    family or worse that will affect you. Eating too much food, will harm you, and likewise if you
                    choose not to eat food, will harm you as well. However having a healthy lifestyle may prevent you
                    from developing disease and having an illness.</p>

                <h2>Save your money</h2>
                <p>In our life there is always a need for us to consult or see a doctor every now and then. It is always
                    advisable to see your doctor for an annual physical examination especially in some health
                    conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, fever, etc. Some are even more complicated to
                    deal with and some are severe. However, the healthier you are, the less you need to see a doctor. In
                    terms of practicality, this can save you money in consultations, prescription needs, and other
                    treatments.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Having a healthy lifestyle is not for aesthetics that you can do to impress other people especially
                    on social media, but it is for your body and it is for you to have good health. It is a way for you
                    to take care of your body and be grateful for it. On the other hand there are some easy ways to
                    start living a healthy lifestyle. This doesn’t mean that you have to cut off your craving or desires
                    in food, hence it is just helping you limit your habits in eating unhealthy foods. Having vegetables
                    as part of your diet is better. Take note that less processed vegetables are better. Instead of
                    eating unhealthy foods like fries, burgers, etc.</p>
