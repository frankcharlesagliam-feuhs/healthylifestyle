				<h1>What is a lifestyle?</h1>
				<p>Lifestyle, according to Meriam Webster, is the way a person lives or a group of people live.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early.
					Not all diseases are preventable, but a large proportion of deaths, particularly those from coronary
					heart disease and lung cancer, can be avoided. Scientific studies have identified certain types of
					behaviour that contribute to the development of noncommunicable diseases and early death. Health is
					not just about avoiding disease. It is also about physical, mental and social well being. When a
					healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive role model is provided in other people in the family,
					particularly children. This website aims to help readers change their behaviour and improve their
					health in order to be healthier and have a longer life.</p>
